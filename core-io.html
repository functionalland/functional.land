<h2 id="io">IO</h2>

<p>The <code>IO</code> type represents a call to IO. Any Functional Programming purist would tell you that your functions has
  to be pure... But in the real world, this is not very useful. Wrapping your call to IO with <code>IO</code> will enable you
  to postpone the side-effect and keep your program (somewhat) pure.</p>

<p>The <code>IO</code> type implements the following algebras:</p>
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" checked="checked" disabled /> Monad</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<pre><code>import IO from "https://deno.land/x/functional@v1.3.2/library/IO.js";

const container = IO(_ => readFile(`${Deno.cwd()}/dump/hoge`))
  .map(promise => promise.then(text => text.split("\n")));
// File isn't being read yet. Still pure.

assert(IO.is(containerA));

const promise = container.run();
// Now, the file is being read.

const lines = await promise;</code></pre>
